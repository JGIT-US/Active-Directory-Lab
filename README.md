<h2>Description</h2>
This lab builds on your previously created IT Home Lab in Oracle VirtualBox, where you set up a small business-style network with Active Directory, DHCP, and Windows 10 clients.
In this phase, youâ€™ll implement JIRA Service Management as a ticketing system within that same virtual environment. This setup provides a complete simulation of a real-world corporate IT service desk. Please reach out to me if you have any questions!
